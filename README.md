# Recall

Recall is an intelligent personal relationship management app that integrates with Gmail to help you remember details about your contacts, generate drafts, and gain insights from your communications.

## Project Structure

*   **/recall_server**: The backend built with Serverpod. Handles Gmail syncing, Gemini AI processing, and database interactions.
*   **/recall_client**: The generated Dart client library (auto-generated by Serverpod).
*   **/recall_flutter**: The Flutter mobile application.

## Setup & Configuration

### Secrets
This project uses a `.env` file to manage secrets. This file is **git-ignored** for security.
You must create a `.env` file in the root directory (and copy it to `recall_server/` and `recall_flutter/` or follow startup scripts) with the following keys:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
SERVER_URL=http://your_server_ip:8080/
```

### Running the Server

2.  Ensure you have Docker running (for Postgres/Redis).
3.  Run migrations:
    ```bash
    dart bin/main.dart --apply-migrations
    ```
4.  Start server:

    ```

### Running the App
